# Binary-Text
Binary Text is an Android cryptography app which allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages. A user needs to type a message and provide a 4 digit PIN to encrypt the message. The encryption process depends on the PIN provided by the user. After successful encryption, user will get a series of binary numbers as encrypted message. Similarly, a user can also decrypt the original message from the encrypted message.
